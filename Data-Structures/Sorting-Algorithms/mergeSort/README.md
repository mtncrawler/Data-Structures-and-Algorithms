### Implementation: Merge Sort

The insertion sort method is an algorithm that accepts an array of integers and returns it with all integers in order from lowest to highest in value. It is a stable algorithm, or it does not change the order of elements with equal value.  

## Complexity 

*Time O(n^2) 

*Space O(1) - the sort is done in-place and does not require any additional memory space
