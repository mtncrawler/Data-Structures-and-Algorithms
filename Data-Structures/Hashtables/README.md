### Hash Tables
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

The basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through what we call a hash. A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

## Challenge

Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:  
	- Add(key, value) - void return
	- Find(string key) - returns the value from key/value pair
	- Contains(string key) - returns bool
	- GetHash(key) - returns array index 

## Approach & Efficiency

*Add()
	- time O(1)
	- space O(1)

*Find()
	- time O(n)
	- space O(1)

*Contains()
	- time O(n)
	- space O(1)

*GetHash()
	- time O(1)
	- space O(1)
