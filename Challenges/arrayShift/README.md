# Insert and Shift an Array

## Challenge
Write a method that will take in an array of integers and an integer value and insert the value in the middle index of the array.
If the array length is odd then round up for the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

1.	Big-O Time = O(n) 
	Big-O Space = O(n)
The Big-O for time and space is O(n) because the algorithm only needs to run n times and the arrays are a fixed length.
